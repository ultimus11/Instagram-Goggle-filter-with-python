With the help of OpenCV and python we add goggles for face.
Steps:
Read original image to apply filter and convert it to grayscale
First do face detection and then detect eyes within face
Record co-ordinates for eyes for width and height calculations to resize filter image i.e. goggle image
Show original image
Read filter image and resize it
Apply overlay
Show output image
